#FLUID LENGTH

Fiber optics are a well-known tool these days. Its applications are multiple, ranging from television, internet, decorations and more. As part of this project, we focused on another of the many uses of fiber optics, we have tried to develop a pressure sensor usingoptical fiber. More specifically, we want:
   1. Determine the pressure according to the intensity transmitted from one fiber to another
   2. Find the depth of a container based on the pressure applied to the diaphragm
   3. Develop python software to receive real-time pressure and intensity variations applied to the device.

Relationship between pressure and height of a fluid:
   The height of a fluid is intimately linked to the pressure exerted on an object or a wall located in this liquid
   p = rho x g = gamma x h
